## CONVO-STREAM

#### Overview:
The project aims to develop a real-time video conference application with screen sharing and chat functionalities. Users will authenticate to join video calls securely. The tech stack includes React (using Vite for quick development), Redux for state management, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The back-end will be powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for data storage.

---

#### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**:
  - React with Vite
  - Redux for state management
  - Hooks for functional components
  - Socket.IO for real-time communication
  - WebRTC for video and audio streaming
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express server
  - MongoDB for database management
  - Socket.IO for WebSocket implementation

---

#### Steps:
1. **Setup Frontend**
   - Initialize React project with Vite
   - Implement Redux for state management
   - Set up basic UI components and structure

2. **Setup Backend with Jest**
   - Create Node.js server using Express
   - Establish MongoDB connection
   - Implement user authentication endpoints
   - Integrate Jest for backend testing

3. **Create Basic Video Conference (R&D)**
   - Research and implement WebRTC for video/audio communication
   - Set up peer-to-peer connection for video calls
   - Implement basic user interface for video conference view

4. **Implement Basic Screen Sharing (R&D)**
   - Investigate and integrate screen sharing using WebRTC
   - Enable screen capture and streaming in the video conference

5. **Implement Communication using Socket.IO (R&D)**
   - Set up Socket.IO for real-time messaging
   - Implement chat feature alongside video conference

6. **UI Development**
   - Design and implement user interface components
   - Ensure responsive design for various devices
   - Integrate chat interface within the application

7. **Testing and Jest**
   - Write unit and integration tests using Jest
   - Ensure test coverage for components, backend, and APIs
   - Implement mocks and assertions for thorough testing

---

#### Best Practices:
- **Componentization**:
  - Each specific functionality has its own component.
  - Reusable components placed in a common repository.

- **Folder Structure**:
  - Organized structure from the beginning for scalability.
  - Separation of concerns (components, APIs, utilities).

- **Optimal Algorithm**:
  - Use optimal algorithms for performance where applicable (e.g., O(n^2)).

---

#### Frontend Structure:
- **src**
  - **components**
    - **common**: Reusable components
    - **specific**: Function-specific components
  - **api**: API request handling
  - **utils**: Utility functions
  - **plugins**: External libraries and plugins
  - **assets**: Static assets (images, fonts)
  - **router**: Navigation and routing
  - **store**: Redux store setup
  - **views**: Main application views and screens

---

#### Common Dependencies:
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Redux
  - React Router DOM
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Socket.IO-client
  - WebRTC

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (mongoose)
  - Socket.IO

---

#### Next Steps (Sunday End):
- Set up the frontend (excluding testing parts).
- Research and experiment with WebRTC in plain JavaScript for initial understanding and integration into the project.
